Doofus Adventure Game

Backstory:
Meet our character Doofus, a cube that loves exploring green platforms called Pulpits. The catch? Pulpits don't last long and disappear within seconds. Doofus has set a challenge to walk on at least 50 Pulpits. 

Characters/Props:
Doofus: The main character (a simple cube will work too).
Pulpit: A green metallic 9x9 platform where Doofus walks.
